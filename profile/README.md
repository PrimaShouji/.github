## Service design checklist
Follow this strictly so Kara doesn't get bogged down by technical debt
* [ ] Does it have a self-contained, Discord-free, super-easy-to-set-up manual testing environment?
* [ ] Does it expose a logging endpoint?
* [ ] Does it have automated unit tests?
* [ ] Does it have automatic deployment to the organization's Nuget package registry and Docker image repository?
* [ ] Does it build and start quickly?
* [ ] Is it free of circular dependencies?
* [ ] Are all of its dependencies explicit?
